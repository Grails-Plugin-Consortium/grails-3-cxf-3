Grails 3 CXF 3 Example Project
------------------------------

I am currently working on porting the grails cxf plugin to grails 3, but in the meantime I wanted to throw together a quick demo on how 
to expose a cxf soap service in grails 3 with the new Spring Boot core.

After running `grails run-app` navigate to http://localhost:8080/services to see the simple exposed service called `ImportantService`.
